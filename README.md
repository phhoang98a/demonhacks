## Inspirations
Every Halloween, trick-or-treaters are tasked with sorting through their hard-earned loot. Many are ultimately disappointed with the assortment of candy they receive due to personal preferences. The product will reduce the risks impacting the demographic, enhances the user experience, and facilitates a safe in-person candy exchange.
## What it does
Virtual candy exchanger automates various tasks, like exchanging candies. It remembers the faces of users, saves the data about their preferences, and informs them about their favorite candy by email.
## How we built it
Built a web app that describes functions such as exchanging candy, viewing and adding user information, and sending emails.
## Challenges we ran into
Limited time, learn about the face recognition model.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I can finish all of the basic functions in 24 hours.
## What we learned
I learned how to upload images to Azure, got acquainted with Flask, think quickly about how to solve the problem in a short time.
## What's next for Virtual candy exchanger
Voice recognition instead of typing, chatbot, image stream
Use this idea to create a virtual assistant
